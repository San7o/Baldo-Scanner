/**
 * @brief Daemon singleton class
 *
 * ## Description
 * This singleton static class is responsible for the main daemon logic.
 * It initializes the daemon by creating a new directory in /etc/antivirus
 * and setting up signal handlers and yaralib. It handles the listening
 * on two different sockets, one for the client (cli tool) and one for the
 * kernel module. The cli tool is used to send messaes to the daemon, 
 * multiple clients can connect to the daemon at the same time as the daemon
 * will spawn one thread per connection. The kernel module is used to send
 * scan requests to the daemon and are recieved by a single socket.
 *
 * ## Threads
 * All the threads spawned by the daemon are tracked by the `threads`
 * vector so that they can be exited or waited later. For each connection
 * and for each scan, a new thread is created. The threads for scanning
 * are stored in a different vector, `scan_threads`, and they cannot be
 * accessed globally, as they are only used to wait for the threads to
 * finish before compleating the scan.
 *
 * ## Shutdown
 * The daemon can be stopped by sending a SIGINT signal, which will
 * trigger a graceful shutdown which will wait for all the threads to
 * finish before exiting. The daemon can also be stopped by sending a
 * SIGTERM or SIGQUIT signal, which will trigger a hard shutdown, exiting
 * forcefully,Ã¬ without waiting for the threads to finish.

 * running out of resources. The value is initialized to

 * of threads that can be run concurrently on the system.
